"Data science", can best be understood as a retronym from the job title "data
scientist".  Scientists at LinkedIn and Facebook came up with this title in
2008, to describe a new generation of highly productive data analysts in the
tech industry [@patil2011building].  The demand for data scientists grew
quickly.  The 2012 article named "Data Scientist" as "The Sexiest Job of the
21st Century" [@davenport2012data]. According to this article: "... what data
scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data ... At ease in the
digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large quantities of formless
data and make analysis possible. ... Data scientists’ most basic, universal
skill is the ability to write code."

At first it was not clear which part of this description was distinctive of
data scientists.  Maybe the new thing was the data (big, complex, varied) or
the analysis strategies (machine learning, artificial intelligence).  A common
response in universities was to design vocational masters programmes with
training in big data and machine learning.

Other authors and institutions began to take a broader view; the changes in
data and analysis were not fundamental to the nature of data science - what
had changed was the _culture_ of data analysis, a culture that treated
programming as a fundamental tool in finding, cleaning, exploring and
analyzing.  In 2013, two large grant-giving bodies awarded \$37.8 million
to support "data science environments" at Berkeley, the University of
Washington and New York University, with broad themes including "Tools and
software", "Reproducibility and open science", and "Physical and intellectual
space" (see [About MSDE](http://msdse.org/about)).  In 2015, David Donoho, an
eminent statistician and computational scientist, distinguished between "Lesser
data science" -- restricted to big data and machine learning -- and "Greater
data science" -- a wider field of the science of learning from data
[@donoho201550]. He argued, convincingly, that data scientists had
rediscovered J.W. Tukey's "data analysis" [@tukey1962future] (see appendix
"Data science and statistics").  He saw great risks in
concentrating on Lesser Data Science: "Choosing in this way is likely to miss
out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years".

As the interpretation of data science matured, so did its position in the
curriculum.  Berkeley found that many undergraduates from different fields
were taking introductory classes in statistics and computer programming, and
concluded that students were responding to a general need for training in
coding for data analysis.  In 2015, they pioneered an entry level
undergraduate course "Foundations in Data Science".  It is open to students in
all schools, including the arts, and has no requirements for university
courses in mathematics or programming (see [data8
policies](http://data8.org/su18/policies.html)).  It has become the fastest
growing program in the University’s history, with 2000 students projected to
enroll for 2017-18 [@mooresloan2017report].  A 2018 report from the US National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine argues that there should be
"development of a basic understanding of data science in all undergraduates"
[@natacad2018ds].

The basic tools for data science training are high-level programming languages,
especially `R` (a statistical programming language) or `Python` (a general
purpose language widely used in science, data science, and teaching)
[@hardin2015data].

In retrospect, the outline of the movement that we now call data science has
been apparent for a number of years.  Many of us have seen exceptional
graduate students or post-docs who have vastly expanded the range of data
they can work on, by using programming.  Our training is starting to reflect
this experience. The first year of Midlands Integrative Biosciences Training
Partnership (MIBTP) programme explicitly teaches programming, and statistics
through programming in `R`; student self-reflection and the quality of its
graduates suggests that this training has had a major impact in their ability
to do research. There is `R` and `Python` training in the Bioinformatics MSc;
a requirement for `R` in the "Network Geographies" third-year module; `Python`
in the "Urban Analytics" module, and a compulsory programming module in the MSc
in Brain Imaging and Cognitive Neuroscience.
